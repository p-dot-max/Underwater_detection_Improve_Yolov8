<h1>🚢 Underwater Object Detection Improvement</h1>

<p><strong>Improving object detection models for underwater environments using YOLOv8 and advanced attention mechanisms</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>📋 Project Overview</h2>

<p>This project focuses on improving underwater object detection models using a large corpus of underwater datasets. By training state-of-the-art models such as YOLOv8 and YOLOv7 and integrating advanced attention mechanisms, we achieved a <strong>3-5% improvement</strong> in accuracy. The implementation of the <strong>Residual Convolutional Block Attention Module (RESCBAM)</strong> into the YOLOv8 backbone contributed to this performance boost, making YOLOv8 a new state-of-the-art model for underwater object detection.</p>
